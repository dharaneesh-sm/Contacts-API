# Project Overview

This project entails developing a contact management application with RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Here's a brief workflow:

1. **Setting Up the Server**: Establishing an Express server to handle HTTP requests.
  
2. **CRUD Operations for Contacts**: Implementing routes and controllers for creating, reading, updating, and deleting contacts.

3. **User Authentication**: Integrating user authentication using JWT tokens, including registration, login, and token verification.

4. **Database Integration**: Configuring MongoDB and defining schemas for both contacts and users.

5. **Middleware and Error Handling**: Implementing middleware for request processing and error handling throughout the application.

6. **Testing with Postman**: Utilizing Postman for testing the implemented APIs and ensuring their functionality.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of backend development, covering route handling, middleware implementation, database integration, authentication, and error handling.
